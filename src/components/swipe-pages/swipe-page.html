Provides horizontally swipeable pages.

The `swipe-pages` element must have `swipe-page` elements as its children.
This ensures readibility of code and a given amount of control on the behavior
of individual pages.

A `swipe-pages` element is an element containing several `swipe-page` elements
as subviews. The `swipe-pages` element is given a certain width and height
through CSS and then each individual `swipe-page` will automatically take of the full size
of the parent element. This means that the `swipe-page` elements are assumed
to all have the exact same size which they all derive from the `swipe-pages`
element.

###Example:

    <swipe-pages selected="1">
      <swipe-page>Hey I'm page 0</swipe-page>
      <swipe-page><h1>Hi, I'm on page 1</h1></swipe-page>
      <swipe-page><p>I am page 2 and I totally rock!</p></swipe-page>
    </swipe-pages>

Swiping left moves to the next page while swiping right moves to the previous page.
This behavior is very typical on mobile applications.
The key to this element is that when swiping, the page follows your finger
horizontally so as to give the user immediate feedback that he/she is swiping
between pages.

Pages only transition when the swipe gesture has crossed a certain threshold
which is exposed by the `threshold` attribute.

###Example:

    <swipe-pages threshold="0.5">
      <swipe-page> ... </swipe-page>
      <swipe-page> ... </swipe-page>
    </swipe-pages>

By setting the `threshold` to 0.5, you ensure that the page will only transition
if the swipe gesture has crossed half the `swipe-pages` width horizontally.

`threshold` accepts values between 0 and 1.

A `threshold` value of 0 implies that any swipe gesture will cause a page
transition. A `threshold` value of 1 implies that no page transition is possible
as you must cross more that the entire size of the `swipe-pages` element horizontally
which is impossible given that the size of the `swipe-pages` element is well-defined.
